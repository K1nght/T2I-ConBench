# Abstract 
Continual postâ€‘training adapts a single textâ€‘toâ€‘image diffusion model to learn new tasks without incurring the cost of separate models, but naÃ¯ve post-training causes forgetting of pretrained knowledge and undermines zeroâ€‘shot compositionality. We observe that the absence of a standardized evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual postâ€‘training. To address this, we introduce <strong>T2Iâ€‘ConBench</strong>, a unified benchmark for continual post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical scenarios, <em>item customization</em> and <em>domain enhancement</em>, and analyzes four dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3) catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines automated metrics, humanâ€‘preference modeling, and visionâ€‘language QA for comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation tools to accelerate research in continual postâ€‘training for textâ€‘toâ€‘image models.
